It&#8217;s been awhile since I did an update on Molly. Since turning one her growth and development has slowed down so monthly updates seem a little silly, but she has done some really cool things lately so an update seemed appropriate.

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">Molly is officially walking&#8230;.she was a little late with this but in the past week or so she has really figured it out and is a walker. She will still crawl and walk with assistance but she can and will walk on her own</span>
  * She has lots of new words. She will say mama, mommy, daddy, kitty, bye-bye, hi, and go and she will sign more, milk, eat, drink, and please. It&#8217;s pretty cool to be able to actually communicate with her.
  * At her 15 month check up she weighed 24lbs 13 ounces and is 31 inches long. She continues to be in the 70-75th percentile for height and weight.
  * She wears mostly 18 month clothes, but can fit into some 12 month stuff and I&#8217;ve put some 24/2T stuff on her it is definitely big but still wearable.
  * Molly was super fun at Christmas this year, she really understood what opening presents was all about and had a lot of fun unwrapping her gifts (and mama and daddy&#8217;s gifts too). She was actually more interested in the gift than the paper and boxes which was cool. I didn&#8217;t expect that.
  * She has really grown in her play skills. She will play with her baby doll giving it it&#8217;s pacifier and bottle, and holding and rocking it. She loves to dance and listen to music. And when she&#8217;s grumpy singing a song will almost always cheer her up. Books have been and continue to be a favorite toy.
  * She is sleeping about 10-11 hours at night and takes two naps a day.

It amazes me daily what she does and how she is growing into such a little person. Every day she does something that is so funny or sweet. I love that I get to be her mom and share all this fun with her.
