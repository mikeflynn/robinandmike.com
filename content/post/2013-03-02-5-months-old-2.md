Just a quick check in to give you Molly&#8217;s five month update&#8230;..

&#8211; She continues to gain weight like a champ and is up to 15 lbs and 10 oz.
  
&#8211; She can still wear her 3 month clothes and 3-6 month sleepers but I&#8217;ve put her in some 6 month clothes and 6-9 month sleepers and they really aren&#8217;t too big.
  
&#8211; All those skills she started doing last month she just keeps getting better.
  
&#8211; Loves to try and sit up, put weight on her legs and stand, and play in her jumperoo.
  
&#8211; She continues to play with her toys and is more engaged when we read stories. 

I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more but that&#8217;s the big stuff I can think of right now.
