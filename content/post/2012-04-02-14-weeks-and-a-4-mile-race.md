This past weekend we passed the 14 week mark and are officially in the second trimester, so to celebrate I ran (and walked) a 4 mile race with my sister, Erin. It was such a nice weekend. Erin came into town on Friday morning and we went to brunch here in St. Louis, then it was off to Cuba. Since Erin is pregnant too (about 6 weeks ahead of me) we thought it would be fun to announce our pregnancies together on Facebook so on Friday we took a picture, posted it online and not even a minute later did we start getting comments and &#8220;likes&#8221; on the photo. It was pretty cool. Erin came into town because we had both signed up to run the Race to the Rocker race in Cuba. It&#8217;s a 4 mile race to the world&#8217;s largest rocker. Kind of a silly concept but it was a beautiful day for a race. We had a great time racing together; Erin and I were both very happy that we finished in under an hour. We hadn&#8217;t really been able to train the way we wanted because of the pregnancies but it was a great race. So I have my first official belly pic, not sure if we will continue taking one each week but I&#8217;m sure there will be more in the future

So there&#8217;s us sisters with our little baby bumps I&#8217;m 14 weeks and Erin is 20. I&#8217;m pretty excited for the next time we get together and can see how big our bumps are then.

Also just for some fun here&#8217;s some pictures from the race&#8230;.
