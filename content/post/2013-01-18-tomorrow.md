Mike get home (well back to St. Louis not really sure what &#8220;home&#8221; is right now) I cannot wait. This week has definitely been long but I think me and Molly have done pretty good on our own. We had some fun dates with other mom friends and it was very cute to see Molly looking at the other babies. We also went to a new breastfeeding group which was a lot of fun. I think we will continue to go until we move. Speaking of moving Mike has been working very hard this week to get us a place to live in CA. Fingers crossed that the place we really like will be ours soon. It&#8217;s been pretty stressful but we keep reminding ourselves that this is the hard part but soon we will be starting this new chapter and hopefully loving it.
