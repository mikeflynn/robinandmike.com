This past Friday we closed on the sale of our St. Louis house. Mike and I are both extremely relieved to not have the stress and financial burden of still owning a house that we no longer live in but it is just a little sad that the house we loved is no longer ours. It wasn&#8217;t easy to get to this place and I can&#8217;t even begin to tell you how many frustrated emails and calls our real estate agent got but now it&#8217;s done. And like Mike said our next house is our last we never want to go through the process of selling a house again.
