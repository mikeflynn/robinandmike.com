It&#8217;s been a couple of days that Michael has been back in Jerusalem and I have been here in St. Louis. I know we made the right decision with me staying here, but there are definitely challenges to living in different time zones. It&#8217;s wonderful to have technology like Skype and Google Talk but there is only a small window of opportunity to use said technology, otherwise one of us is sleeping. I&#8217;m so lucky to have my little sister Ashley living just down the street from me so she spends a lot of time over here keeping me and Abby company and also Michael made this awesome <a href="http://itsalmo.st/#timeformichaeltobehome" target="_blank">countdown</a> online so I can always look and see exactly how much more time he has in Jerusalem.
