Lots of stuff has been going on here at our house. My little sister has spent time with us, one so that she can look at apartments in the area and also so that we could get ready for Erin&#8217;s birthday party that we had at the house. Some big news we finally finished the table and the cart!!! Yay!!!!!! Pictures will be with the party pics.
