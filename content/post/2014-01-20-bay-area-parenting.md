We&#8217;ve been here in the Bay Area for almost a year and there are some thing that are so different from the Midwest especially when it comes to parenting and eduction. I&#8217;m starting to realize there is a lot of competition among parents here when it comes to their children&#8217;s education. Molly is not even one and a half and I&#8217;ve already heard comments about how we should be looking at preschools and how we should be on waiting lists for the top preschools and some people were shocked that I have no plans to put Molly in preschool next year (seriously she won&#8217;t even be two) and possibly not even the next year (because she would then have three years of preschool). Back in St. Louis I don&#8217;t think any of my friends would have thought twice that I&#8217;m not looking at preschools. It&#8217;s a weird reality check, trying to stay true to who you are as a parent but also looking at the reality of the culture that you are living in. For me I feel like it&#8217;s more important to stay true to our family and our values and not get caught up in what&#8217;s around me. Right now our plan is to go back to Little Wonders (Molly weekly parent child play group) next year and look at possible activities in our new community of Pacifica. It can be hard though thinking that your ideas are wrong since they are different then the norm and you keep hearing the exact opposite of what you think is true but I&#8217;m really trying to remember what&#8217;s right for us.
