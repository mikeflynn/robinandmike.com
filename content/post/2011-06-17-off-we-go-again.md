So we are packing up again tonight and are headed back to Jerusalem tomorrow. I&#8217;ll write a much better and longer post about St. Croix and all our St. Croix adventures and getting back to Israel, but for now we are excited to go and be done. I&#8217;m sad to leave again but glad to know the next time I come home it will be for good. I&#8217;ll keep you posted again once we get back.
