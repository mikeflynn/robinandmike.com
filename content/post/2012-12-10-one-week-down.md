Mike has been in San Francisco for a week now and gets back this Saturday. We are so excited to have him back with us!! We had some rough moments during the week but got through them all. I&#8217;m so blessed to have friends and family willing to help out. It was a little sad to put up the Christmas tree without Mike here to help. But the tree is beautiful and I can&#8217;t wait to celebrate Molly&#8217;s first Christmas. 

So only a few more days!! Can&#8217;t wait until we are all in the same time zone again and Abby can&#8217;t wait to get another lap in the house.
