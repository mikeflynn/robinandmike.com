Since I&#8217;m currently not working I decided that it would be a good time to take a trip up to South Dakota and visit family there. Since I&#8217;m the only one in my family that isn&#8217;t working I had to take the trip solo. It was so funny how worried I was to travel up there alone. I&#8217;ve traveled alone plenty of times so the travel didn&#8217;t make me nervous, but the driving to the farm from the airport alone, getting to my Uncle Vic&#8217;s house from the farm alone, coordinating what to do during my trip and not having my mom do all of that for us was a little nerve wracking. But it really turned out to be a great trip. I left from St. Louis early Wednesday morning and my little sister was nice enough to take me to the airport at 5am. I landed in Sioux Falls SD at around 10:30am, so I got my rental car and took off to the farm. I hung out with Grandma and Uncle Larry and had dinner with them, after dinner I took off to Uncle Vic&#8217;s.

Thursday I got up early and had breakfast with Vic and then headed to Grandma&#8217;s to pick her up and then we took off to Mitchell. We had a great day hanging out with my great-aunts Evelyn and Mary Louise. It&#8217;s so great to see them, I have a feeling when my sisters and I get older it is exactly how we will be. My cousins came over to Vic&#8217;s house for dinner Thursday night so we had a great time catching up.

Friday I spent the morning and most of the afternnon with Grandma and then I went to Stickney with Vic for the homecoming parade. I was so excited that my cousin Vanessa was going to be bringing her family to Vic&#8217;s that night so that her husband could help with harvest. I got to spend time with her little ones and get caught up with them also.

Overall it was an absolutely amazing trip. I joke that it was too easy so I will just have to come again even if it&#8217;s by myself.
