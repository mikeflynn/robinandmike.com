Today is our third wedding anniversary, we both keep forgetting since everything has changed so much for us in the past week. I can say without any doubt that I never thought I would be spending any anniversary with Michael in Jerusalem. Funny how life changes and you weren&#8217;t even looking for it. I&#8217;m so happy and blessed that we are able to spend this special day together and that we didn&#8217;t have to be apart for the summer. Even though we continue to be freaked out on a daily basis, it is getting better and at least we are here together.
