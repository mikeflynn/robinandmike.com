How crazy is it that baby Molly is one month old today. I looked at the calendar and realized that I completely lost October. Life with a newborn is absolutely nuts, I had no idea how crazy hard it would be. I heard all the horror stories and knew it would be hard but man you really have no idea until you live it. And it&#8217;s not just the constant breastfeeding and sleeplessness but also questioning everything. I find myself always asking &#8220;am I doing this right&#8221; &#8220;should I be doing more&#8221; &#8220;what&#8217;s this?&#8221; and the list goes on and on. Luckily I have a very understanding and amazing pediatrician with phone hours so I can call him up and ask questions when it&#8217;s needed. 

So it&#8217;s been a month and already we have learned a lot about each other and Molly has changed so much already, here&#8217;s some highlights&#8230;.
  
-Molly is almost too big for her newborn clothes and is wearing mostly 0-3 month size.
  
-She loves being held up on your shoulder and snuggling in your neck
  
-When she&#8217;s swaddled up she will typically sleep pretty well. The last two nights she gave us 6 and 8 hours at night it was awesome.
  
-Molly likes to lay under her activity gym and look at the toys. She can&#8217;t quite bat at them purposefully but she likes looking at them.
  
-When she gets really fussy she likes to dance with her dad.
  
-Breastfeeding really does get easier
  
-A little makeup, fixed hair and real clothes really help me feel much better and we usually have better days.
  
-At her two week doctors appointment she weighed 9lbs 5oz so I&#8217;m guessing she is now getting close to 10lbs.
  
-She is spending more time awake which can be a lot of fun when she&#8217;s not crying. 

That&#8217;s all I can think of now, it&#8217;s been one heck of a month but we are so looking forward to the next ones.
