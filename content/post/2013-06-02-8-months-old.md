So some fun stuff from this past month&#8230;

-Molly will say &#8220;Mama&#8221; and &#8220;Dada&#8221; to me and Mike when she wants us. Pretty dang cute.
  
-She continues to experiment with solid food. We gave up on pur√©ed baby food so she gets chunks of stuff she can hold on to. Some favorites are strawberries and any veggie stick with hummus.
  
-She is wearing 9 month clothes but can still fit her 6 month stuff it&#8217;s just a little short in the arms.
  
-Still no teeth and no crawling/scooting and no standing/pulling herself up. She will lunge forward when sitting for a toy but if she can&#8217;t get it she usually gives up for something closer. She also figured if said toy is on a blanket she can pull the blanket to get it. Pretty smart.
  
-Sleep is pretty much the same still getting up once at night to eat. Since traveling about a week ago she has been struggling a little to get back to sleep after that feeding, but I&#8217;m hopeful that in the next week that will continue to improve.
  
-Molly likes to read books with me and Mike and she especially likes the peek-a-boo books.

Her next well baby doctor visit will be later this month so we will know her height and weight then.
