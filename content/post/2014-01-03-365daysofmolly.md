[Water for Mothers][1] is a favorite blog of mine. I&#8217;ve been reading and following Nisha&#8217;s story since before her daughter Alice was born and recently she finished a year long photo challenge. A year of taking and posting a photo every day of her daughter. I decided that this would be a fun challenge that I would also like to take on. Now that Molly is more of a toddler and busy all day I am no longer taking pictures of her and I would always scrutinize those pictures that I would post. So starting yesterday I&#8217;m posting a picture a day of Molly with the tag #365daysofmolly on Instagram. You can follow me on Instagram with the username robinflynn. Hope you enjoy seeing the pictures as much as I enjoy taking them.
