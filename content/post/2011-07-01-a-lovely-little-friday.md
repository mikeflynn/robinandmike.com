Michael and I have gotten into a little routine on Fridays, we get up (usually a little late) and walk downtown for lunch. Last week it was Holy Bagel, this week we went to MeatBurger for cheeseburgers. We walked around downtown a bit and stopped at Iwo&#8217;s Deli for bacon and cheese, then we made our weekly trip to the grocery store to stock up before the town shuts down at sundown. Now we are hanging out at home both sitting on the couch with our laptops. Kind of a nice nothing special sort of day.
