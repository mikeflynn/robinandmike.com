This year Mike had his first official I&#8217;m a daddy Father&#8217;s Day. I really wanted to celebrate the day and make it special but wasn&#8217;t totally sure how to do that. I make brunch (smoothies and a potato chip omelette) to start, luckily my sister Ashley was still visiting and helped with the cooking. We spent most of the day just hanging out. Mike grilled steaks for dinner, I made twice baked potatoes and a coconut custard pie for dessert. It was just a nice easy day. Mike&#8217;s birthday was just a few days later and we spent his actual birthday in the city with Mike&#8217;s parents who were in town visiting. Then Sunday was the real celebration I got Mike and I reservation at the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay for there famous brunch buffet. Molly stayed home with Grandma and Grandpa Flynn while Mike and I ate ourselves stupid. It was incredible. The food was absolutely amazing truly some of the best food I have ever had and the views of the ocean were also spectacular. Mike and I were both kind of amazed that this beautiful location was only about 30 minutes away. We had to keep reminding ourselves that we live here now. Pretty awesome. Here&#8217;s some pictures from all the fun.
