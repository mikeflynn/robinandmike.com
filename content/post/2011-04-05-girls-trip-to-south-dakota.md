My mom, sisters, and I piled into a car and drove to South Dakota for a trip to see family. It was an amazing trip. We got to see our Grandma and hang out at her new house. We make a side trip to Minnesota to see new baby Nolan and visit with my cousin Vanessa and see her little girls. It is always so nice to get to see everyone especially the great aunts. Monday afternoon was spent with Grandma and Evelyn and then Tuesday we got to see Mary Louise. Getting disconnected from the internet and from my cell phone is such a nice thing some times. I&#8217;m so happy to be home with Michael and Abby and now it&#8217;s time to get ready for our trip to Israel. So excited for what&#8217;s next!![<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-134" title="Grandma and Mary Louise Looking at the old photo book" src="http://robinandmike.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0153-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://robinandmike.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0153-300x224.jpg 300w, http://robinandmike.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_0153-1024x764.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][1][][2]

Here&#8217;s Grandma and Mary Louise looking through an old photo album trying to figure out who each person is.

We had to snuggle up in the back seat. Â It was so cold but we still had a great time!!!!
