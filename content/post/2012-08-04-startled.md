Today Mike and I were having lunch at Ninth Street Deli (small little sandwich place close to our house) I could feel Baby moving around a little bit nothing crazy just normal movement. All of a sudden there was a loud noise and baby jumped like she got startled. It was so funny. It so crazy when things like that happen&#8230;.she is a little person we just can&#8217;t hold her yet. We are definitely getting anxious and ready to meet this little one. Two more months.
