Last week (so more like last month but things got busy and I&#8217;m just now gettung this finished) we celebrated Molly&#8217;s third birthday. We had a great day opening presents, having special birthday pasta, and birthday cake. Celebrations have become a lot more fun with her now that sue understands and gets why we are celebrating.
