Well geez things have been busy here so this is quite late. But Mike and I took an amazing vacation and our little Molly turned 7 months old. Nothing too crazy has happened in baby development land&#8230;.here&#8217;s some highlights
  
&#8211; Molly sits up unassisted for pretty long periods of time
  
&#8211; She hates pur√©ed food but likes to munch on veggie sticks, fruit in the mesh feeder, and hummus
  
&#8211; Molly has one middle of the night feeding but will sleep from about 7:30pm to 6:30 or 7am. Not too shabby.
  
&#8211; She did amazing taking the bottle from my mom while we were gone.
  
&#8211; She is getting more vocal and loves to see herself on FaceTime.
  
&#8211; She loves bath time and is pretty funny playing in the water.
  
&#8211; Molly is wearing 6-9 month clothes
  
-She is loving &#8220;reading&#8221; her books and we started going to story time at the library. 

So that&#8217;s some of the fun stuff&#8230;.only about one more week or so and she will be an 8 month old.
