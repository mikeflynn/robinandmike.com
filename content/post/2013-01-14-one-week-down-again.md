It&#8217;s been a week since Mike went back to CA and it was so much harder to say bye this time. While Mike was in St. Louis, he wasn&#8217;t working over the holiday so we had two awesome weeks together as a family. So it was so sad to say bye but it just means we are that much closer to being together in CA. Molly and I spent most of last week with my parents in Cuba. I had a bit of a head cold and was happy to have some help with Molly in the evenings. We are back in St Louis and have some fun dates planned with friends this week and are anxiously waiting for Mike to get back on Saturday.
