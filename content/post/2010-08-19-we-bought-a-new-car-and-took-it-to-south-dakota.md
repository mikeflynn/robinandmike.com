So in the middle of July, Michael and I started seriously talking about a new car for Michael. We looked at the Toyota RAV 4 and the Honda CRV. We ended up buying a new black Honda CRV with beige leather interior. It is so nice and roomy. We ultimately decided that we needed something larger that could fit more than just groceries. A couple of weeks after we bought the car, Michael and I took a little road trip in it. We drove to Mitchell, SD for my Grandma&#8217;s 85th birthday party. It was a very quick trip I wish we could have stayed longer but it was wonderful to spend time with our extended family. We spent an afternoon at the farm and had lunch in the little town of Stickney. Michael was pretty amazed at the size of the town. All in all it was a great trip and like always we are looking forward to seeing everyone again.
