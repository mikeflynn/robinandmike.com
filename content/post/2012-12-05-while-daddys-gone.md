Sunday night Mike took off on a plane for San Francisco so he could start his new job Monday morning. That leaves me, Molly, and Abby here on our own. I&#8217;m not going to lie it kind of sucks it really makes my heart go out to all the soldiers&#8217; wives that have to parent on their own for months at a time. It&#8217;s not easy but we are doing good. Abby really misses having another lap to sit on in the house; she just looks so sad, but I&#8217;m hoping she adjusts soon. Molly is doing well, really she&#8217;s pretty happy as long as she&#8217;s getting fed every couple hours, but I miss having Mike come home in the evening so I get a little break. But we are making it work, last night I made dinner while holding Molly then I ate sitting on the floor with her in the bouncy seat while I bounced her with my foot. It was quite the sight but you know I got to eat and she was mostly happy. The hardest thing is that with the time difference by the time Mike leaves work it&#8217;s after 7pm here which is right when Molly starts getting super fussy and ready for bed, not great for FaceTime we were able to chat for a few minutes last night but I&#8217;m hoping we can try maybe a lunch time FaceTime date. Only about a week and a half then Mike will be home for the holidays and we can&#8217;t wait!!
