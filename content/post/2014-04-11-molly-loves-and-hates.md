Molly is getting older and much more opinionated which is awesome but just a tad frustrating. I thought it would be nice to write some of these things down to remember later. So first up some things that Molly just LOVES

1. Elmo &#8211; we got her a little stuffed Elmo that she sleeps with it and goes most places with her

2. Sesame Street &#8211; if I would let her Molly would watch this all day every day.

3. Reading books &#8211; she likes reading with Mike and me and also by herself. Her favorite books right now are Chicka Chicka Boom Boom and her Batman and Superman board books.

4. Crackers &#8211; if she asks for a snack she also asks for crackers

5. Taking a bath &#8211; best part of her bedtime routine.

6. Coloring &#8211; this is pretty new but she really loves coloring with her markers

7. Playing outside &#8211; now that we have a backyard we spend a lot of time out there

And now somethings Molly absolutely HATES

1. Drinking milk &#8211; Molly stopped nursing about a month ago and I&#8217;ve been giving her cows milk for months and she turns her head and pushes away the cup every single time

2. Getting her diaper changed/getting dressed &#8211; makes getting ready in the morning super fun

3. Getting in the car seat &#8211; once she&#8217;s in there it&#8217;s okay but the process is painful

4. Getting carried or riding in a stroller &#8211; the girl can walk and she want to

5. Not being able to tell me what she wants &#8211; she has so much language but not enough sometimes and boy can she get frustrated
