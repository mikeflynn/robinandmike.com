We&#8217;ve known about this adventure for a few weeks now but it took us awhile before we were ready to go public with the news. So Mike has gotten a new job and we are moving to San Francisco. We are so excited but I&#8217;m definitely nervous. I&#8217;m not sure exactly what the timeline is going to look like but hopefully we will all be in CA together by February next year. It&#8217;s going to be a crazy couple of months but I can&#8217;t wait!
