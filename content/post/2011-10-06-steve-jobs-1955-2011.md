Normally I keep what I post on this site to just what Michael and I are up to and our adventures; however, the passing of Steve Jobs was just too important of an event for me to pass it by and to not type up my own thoughts on it.

I worked for Apple Retail from June 2008 until April 2011 and I only left at that time so that I could travel with Michael to Jerusalem. It was truly an honor to work for such an amazing company and we have one man to thank for creating such an amazing store and company and that was Steve Jobs. Apple has such a rich history with it&#8217;s almost failure to then reaching new heights when the iPod first came out. Steve truly changed the world. The way I listen to and buy music was changed because of Steve. The way I view my photos, create movies, talk to my sister who lives in Atlanta has changed and is better because of Steve&#8217;s vision and the fact that he did everything possible to make his vision come to life. He did not compromise or waver from what his vision was or stop until it came to life.

So I just wanted to take a minute to just say thank you! I&#8217;m sure others who knew him can say more and can say it with more grace, but I truly appreciate what Steve Jobs brought to my life and I will never forget him.
