_Update: So my mom told me that the Babies R Us link isn&#8217;t taking you directly to our registry. So you will have to search try searching just our last name Flynn and just &#8220;R&#8221; in the first name or by the registry number 48530699_

This was one of those things that I wasn&#8217;t exactly avoiding but I just got a little overwhelmed with the idea. My good friend Anne volunteered to go with me to explore the aisles of Babies R Us, but today I decided to just bite the bullet and go. I went by myself since Mike was working and I think that was the best decision. I will want my mom or other trusted mom friend to look over it just to make sure I didn&#8217;t overlook anything important. Both registries are available online at [babiesrus.com][1] and at [cottonbabies.com][2]. You can just search by my name or Mike&#8217;s. It&#8217;s one of those funny milestones that I didn&#8217;t really know I wanted to complete but it really does feel good to be picking out things and looking at the stuff we will need once this little girl arrives.
