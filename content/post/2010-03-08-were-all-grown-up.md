So Mike and I are all grown up and I feel like we actually have a house because we&#8230;get ready for it&#8230;.Bought a Dining Room Table!!! Yay!! Finally, we&#8217;ve lived in this house for over a year and have had an empty beautiful dinning room, but not for long our new table will be ready to be picked up on Saturday. I can&#8217;t wait. All the shopping and fun made me and Abby really tired so we took a nap.
