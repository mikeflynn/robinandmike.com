It has been pretty busy at the Flynn household but since Michael is working super late tonight I thought I would take some time and recap our trip to St. Croix for Michael&#8217;s younger brother, Matt&#8217;s, wedding. Since I&#8217;m so late posting this I will just give you the bullet points..

1. Yelling and cussing is not an appropriate way to handle your frustrations on a plane. Thanks angry passengers for reminding us of that again.

2. St. Croix is extremely hot and humid in June. We literally sweated the entire time we were on the island.

3. Driving on the left hand side of the road is weird and a little unnerving. Also driving on the curvy remote island roads is not fun.

4. Staying in the town with all the locals allows you to really see the St. Croix characters not sure if that is a good or a bad thing. I think Michael would say bad since he got yelled at by someone at the grocery store.

5. Do not expect lots of fresh seafood at St. Croix weird I know since it&#8217;s an island but there was not much.

6. The fresh seafood that they do have is amazing. Fresh mahi mahi tacos and yellowfin tuna was spectacular.

7. Weddings on the beach are beautiful, even if we were all sweating through our clothes.

8. Swimming in the ocean is always fun even if there are creatures.

9. Definitely drink the Cruzan Rum. It&#8217;s made on the island and is great.

10. Finally do not fly into the same town as the president it will cause major delays at the airport. But seeing Air Force One in person was kind of cool.

All in all we really did have a great trip. It&#8217;s always good to spend time with family and welcome a new Mrs. Flynn into the mix. Congratulations Matt and Alesya we are so happy for you!!!
