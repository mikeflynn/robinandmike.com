Mike and I spent an extended weekend in Atlanta, GA for my older sisters wedding&#8230;here are the highlights

1. Mike ate a hamburger called &#8220;The Coronary Bypass&#8221; at the Vortex Bar and Grill and has now decided that he needs to eat the bigger one next time. Not sure how I feel about that.

2. We Â know how to drive a minivan and have decided that we will never own one.

3. Erin Durick is now officially Erin Townsend and there is only one Durick girl left.

4. Driving in Midtown Atlanta is worse than Downtown St. Louis&#8230;didn&#8217;t think that was possible.

5. We definitely need to take more vacations because it was an amazing time!!!!

Congrats to Erin and Chris, we had an incredible time, but are so happy to be back home with our Abby girl.
