As we&#8217;ve been walking around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv one thing has really stood out, there is a lot of street graffiti/art. It is really neat to see. We have noticed some pieces are all over the city, particularly this bunny. Michael has been trying to figure out who puts it out there, but so far we don&#8217;t have an answer. It has become kind of a where&#8217;s waldo game for us, trying to find the bunny when we are on new streets or different areas of town. Here&#8217;s the link to the street art gallery <a href="http://gallery.me.com/robinflynn1#100233" target="_blank">http://gallery.me.com/robinflynn1</a>
