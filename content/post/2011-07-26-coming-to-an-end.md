So this little adventure that Michael and I have been on since April is coming to a close. Sometimes I just kind of marvel at the fact that we have been living in Israel I mean come on Israel. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that this would have happened to me. I have to admit that even though I may complain about living in Jerusalem there really are things that I will miss about living here. It has been a lovely ride, I&#8217;m just a little homesick and extremely excited to get home and see all my wonderful friends and my family. Honestly if it wasn&#8217;t for their support this would have been a much more difficult journey.

We&#8217;ve got just over a week left here together in Jerusalem. In some ways it feels like I&#8217;ve been here forever and in others it seems like we just got here. I said in one of my first post about being here in Jerusalem that I felt like Michael and I would become closer since we were here pretty much alone together, and that 100% has been the case. He is and will always be my best friend, partner, soulmate. I feel extremely blessed to have met and married him. Being here with him has been amazing. There have been good days and of course there have been bad days when neither one of us wanted to be here anymore, but having each other to lean on has showed me how much we really do rely on each other. And that&#8217;s pretty spectacular. I feel so lucky that we have been able to see that in eachother and I think making this move really allowed us to see that.

I&#8217;m excited that we were here, I&#8217;m so happy that I got the opportunity to live in another country especially one that is so misunderstood. The people of Israel and Jerusalem love there country and their city so much and that really shows. I will never understand all of the religious based rules or all the conflicts with the surrounding countries, but one thing is obvious this place is the most wonderful place to all of them. I&#8217;m glad that I got to see that. American news makes Israel and the surrounding lands out to be filled with anger, hate, and conflict and that could not be futher from the truth. While there is conflict, it isn&#8217;t felt in day to day life. Israel is a beautiful country and this histroy here is breathtaking. It is not scary or filled with fighting. If you ever get the chance to travel overseas Jerusalem should definitely be on your list of places to see. I hope if nothing else I can walk away with my eyes open. And I think I will.
