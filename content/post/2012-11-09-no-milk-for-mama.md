Starting right around five weeks old Molly started get extremely fussy&#8230;.like hours of crying, not sleeping, not wanting to eat, painful gas which made for some unhappy days here. I talked with Molly&#8217;s pediatrician and he recommended me eliminating some things from my diet to see if it would help her. So I stopped eating gassy foods like beans and spicy stuff and I also eliminated dairy. Which basically leaves nothing fun to eat, but it seems to be helping little Miss&#8217;s belly. She still grunts, strains, and sometimes cries when she is pooping or having gas but it is nothing like it was. So for now I will continue to give up cheese even though I love it because having a happy baby who will sleep is so much better.
