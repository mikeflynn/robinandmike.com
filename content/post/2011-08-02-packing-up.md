So here we are again, packing up all of our stuff, but this time we are headed back to St. Louis instead of coming here. It&#8217;s pretty crazy I really can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s time to come home again. I knew the time would go by fast and it truly did. During this last week as we&#8217;ve been walking around at night I&#8217;ve been kind of reminiscent. Thinking of those first few days here, when we didn&#8217;t have a clue what to do where to go. I really remember that first full day when it was raining and we were walking around a packed Old City. I was so ready to turn around and go back home. I was miserable, but each day got better and better and now I&#8217;m so glad that we came. Sometimes I still just sit and look at the fact that Israel is where we spent the summer. It&#8217;s so crazy! It&#8217;s been a really weird incredible ride. Michael&#8217;s work here is far from done so he will be returning and we aren&#8217;t totally sure what that is going to look like, but I&#8217;m confident that no matter what is thrown our way we will figure it out.
