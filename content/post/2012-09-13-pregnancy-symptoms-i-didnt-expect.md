So I&#8217;m 37 weeks and 5 days pregnant and definitely ready for this little one to move on out but I was thinking today that there have been a number of things happen to my body and emotions that I didn&#8217;t really expect so I thought I would share&#8230;

1. That my feet would swell to the point that I couldn&#8217;t comfortably wear my own socks. I have to borrow Mike&#8217;s and squeeze into gym shoes when I want to walk. 

2. That my belly would get so big that I couldn&#8217;t reach the sink comfortably to do the dishes. I have to stand sideways in front o the sink. Kind of funny. 

3. That it would be a 10 minute event to change what side I&#8217;m sleeping on during the night. And even then its a painful event. 

4. That getting your teeth cleaned could be like torture due to pregnancy gingivitis. Had a cleaning today and I have never hated the dentist more, my gums were so swollen and sore. I will go back after the baby comes just to double check that there isnt any lasting damage. 

5. That water can you heartburn.

6. That I would hate all the attention in public, especially now that I&#8217;m so big. I cant go anywhere without strangers making comments and wanting to talk. Not sure why but I do not like the attention. 

That&#8217;s all I can think of for now. It&#8217;s been such a crazy journey but we are so ready for the next one.
