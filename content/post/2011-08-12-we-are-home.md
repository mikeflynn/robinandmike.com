It&#8217;s been about a week and we are slowly settling back in at home. It is definitely a different kind of adjustment, but still an adjustment back into St. Louis life. I&#8217;m bumming that Michael is leaving again so soon, but the sooner he leaves the sooner he will be coming back home. For now it&#8217;s been great being at home, cooking, and hanging out with Abby (our cat).
