Molly and I came to Atlanta for the 4th of July so that we could hang out with Erin, Chris and Hayden (and also my parents who were here) but also so I could run in the Peachtree 10K with Erin. This year was the 45th (I think that&#8217;s right) annual race in downtown Atlanta. It is a huge race apparently the largest 10k in the world. Erin and I got up early to head downtown. Everyone else stayed back because it was a wet rainy day. Because the race has around 60,000 runners they have start waves, Erin&#8217;s wave started about 45 minutes before mine so she was off and then I stood in my group and waited. Pretty soon it was my turn. It ended up being a pretty awesome run. I was extremely happy for the wet rainy day I wasn&#8217;t sure I could handle the 6 miles in the typical Atlanta heat. I still got plenty hot and sweaty just from the humidity. It was kind of a tough run with some significant hills from miles 3 &#8211; 5 with one hill being dubbed Cardiac Hill. But it was a lot of fun; I&#8217;ve never ran in a race even close to that size so that was pretty incredible. It of course helps that I was pretty pleased with my time too, I finished in 1 hour 9 minutes and 26 seconds. The crazy thing is even though Erin and I didn&#8217;t run together we had almost the exact same time she finished in 1 hour 10 minutes and 16 seconds. It&#8217;s been a great trip and an awesome run I&#8217;m getting more and more excited for my next race which will be the San Jose Half Marathon in October!!

And just for fun here&#8217;s a pic of me and Erin after the race was over.
