Michael comes home in 4 days!!! I am beyond excited I know he is so ready to be back and we are so ready for him to be home. It certainly has not been easy with him being so far away for this long, but it&#8217;s almost over!! I&#8217;m just keeping all my fingers and toes crossed that he will stay in the US for longer than two weeks. But right now with no ticket purchased to return to Jerusalem it&#8217;s looking pretty good that he will be around for a little while. I cannot wait!!
