Nothing too exciting here at the Flynn household. I&#8217;m a little embarrassed to admit but I finally got unpack from our trip to Atlanta. As much as I love vacations there is just a lot of work that goes into them, and my schedule at work gets a little crazy so it&#8217;s been a lot of working since we got back, but I have the weekend off so hopefully I will be able to get caught up on some housework and also enjoy just some time at home. The table comes tomorrow I can&#8217;t wait!!! I&#8217;ll get pictures as soon as we have it home and in the dinning room. Otherwise it&#8217;s just work and hang out at home. But it&#8217;s like my mom says no news is sometimes good news.
