Today Mike and I are celebrating our 2nd anniversary, pretty crazy how fast time seems to go by.  This weekend has been nice since I was able to be home. Lots of lounging around&#8230;especially for Abby.  We had lunch with Mike&#8217;s parents today at the Tin Can which was really nice. No other major anniversary plans for us though. We have been doing lots of work around the house the last month or so.  The last couple of weeks it felt like we were living in a construction zone because we had tuckpointers fixing our brick work everyday.  My parents helped us to paint Michael&#8217;s office, and we got a new bench for our kitchen/entry way area.  Thanks Mom for the awesome birthday gift even if it was  a pain in the butt to put together.

It&#8217;s raining today which just seems fitting since we were so worried about the weather at our wedding.  But all in all in was an amazing day, I&#8217;m so lucky that I&#8217;ve been married to Michael for the past two years and can&#8217;t wait for the years to come. I love you!!
