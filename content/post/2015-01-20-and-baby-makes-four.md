Mike, Molly and I are all very excited to be expecting a new baby in early July this year. It&#8217;s funny just how different pregnancy is the second time around, not only do I have my little side kick at all my doctor appointments, but not nearly as much time has been spent thinking about this little one. Life with a two year old is much busier than when I was pregnant with Molly and wasn&#8217;t working. We aren&#8217;t 100% sure but are thinking this little one is a boy (we have our big gender ultrasound in about three weeks) and as the weeks go on I&#8217;m more convinced that this is a little boy. This pregnancy feels very different than Molly&#8217;s, sometimes I think it&#8217;s because being pregnant with a toddler is so different than not and really yes that is different but I&#8217;m still feeling different.  I&#8217;m currently 16 weeks and here&#8217;s some of the biggest  differences I&#8217;ve noticed so far.

With Molly I had morning sickness/nausea but it was pretty tolerable and I could always find something to eat and would feel better. This time around I have felt much sicker and have truly struggled to find things to eat which always makes me feel worse.

With Molly I had a very few cravings and food aversions. This time I have had very strong cravings and when something tastes good is tastes so good, but when it doesn&#8217;t it really tastes awful. Mike has been keeping track of somethings that seem to always taste good so when I get stuck and can&#8217;t find anything to eat he has some suggestions.

With Molly I was able to sleep comfortably until my third trimester and then by then I was just too big to be comfortable sleeping. This time I have already for weeks but having a hard time sleeping. I toss and turn (I&#8217;m a belly sleeper and while I&#8217;m not showing a lot it is already uncomfortable on my stomach) get hot and then cold and wake up to every little disturbance.

With Molly I didn&#8217;t really notice much of a change with my emotions and patience. This time (and probably since I&#8217;m living with a two year old) I feel a lot less patient and just more on edge.

Mike has joked that this time I got very pregnant quickly and a lot of the things that didn&#8217;t bother me with Molly until well into the last trimester I&#8217;m already bothered with and barely in the second trimester. I&#8217;m sure we will all be very ready for this little one to make his (or her) debut.
