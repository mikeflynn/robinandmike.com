It&#8217;s been a long three weeks, but it really went by fast and finally tomorrow I go to the airport to pick Mike up! I cannot wait this much time and distance between us is definitely a challenge, but thanks to technology he didn&#8217;t feel too far away. It will be a very quick trip for him in the US, but hopefully we will have a good trip to St. Croix and then before we know it it will be back to Jerusalem for both of us. I have a feeling the tomorrow is going to be a very long day here waiting and anticipating for his plane to get here, but I absolutely cannot wait to see my amazing husband. Fingers crossed that everything goes smoothly with his flights and he has safe travels and will be home in St. Louis before I know it. Can&#8217;t wait!
