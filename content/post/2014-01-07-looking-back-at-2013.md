It&#8217;s crazy to me that once again the holidays are over and we are starting another year. 2013 had some highs and some lows but overall I wouldn&#8217;t change a thing. So here&#8217;s my quick recap of the best and worst moments of the year.

**BEST**
  
Moving to California
  
Taking a Vegas vacation with Mike
  
Running the Peachtree Road Race
  
Taking Molly to my grandparents farm
  
Running in the San Jose half marathon
  
Molly&#8217;s first birthday and party with Hayden
  
All of Molly&#8217;s wonderful firsts: crawling, talking, eating solid food, hugs and kisses well you get the idea
  
Celebrating 5 years of marriage
  
Selling our MO house

**WORST**
  
Saying goodbye to our MO friends and family
  
Miles 11 and 12 of the half marathon
  
Starting over in a brand new place
  
Taking a huge loss on the sale of our home
  
Sleep training Molly
  
Living in an apartment 

It&#8217;s been crazy ride and I wouldn&#8217;t trade any of them or who I got to spend them with. I am so fortunate.
