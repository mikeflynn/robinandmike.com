So just like I thought the So You Think You Can Dance show was amazing just like last year. Except this year all the girls were there. Erin flew in from Atlanta on Friday night so Ashley, Mike, Erin, and I had a great time out that night in Soulard. Then Saturday Mom join us for dinner and the show. It was incredible as much as I LOVE watching it on TV seeing them dance live is truly amazing. I think we started a tradition of going to the tours each year that they have them. Can&#8217;t wait for the next one. The weekend was such girly fun. It went by way to fast and too soon it was early Sunday morning and we were all saying bye to Erin again. Hopefully she will be able to come visit again soon. Here&#8217;s some pictures from that night.
