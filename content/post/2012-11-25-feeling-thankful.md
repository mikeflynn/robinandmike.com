Last year at this time I wasn&#8217;t feeling my best. Mike and I had been trying to have a baby for well over a year and were starting to get scared that it couldn&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t happen for us. We were starting to do some tests and got an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist. It was just a rough time feeling so unsure about what our future would hold and whether or not a child would be in our story. 

Fast forward to this year when our baby girl Molly had her first Thanksgiving. It&#8217;s been a crazy ride and there are days when I wonder what in the heck we were thinking, but honestly I couldn&#8217;t be more thankful for her. To be so unsure about whether or not we would have a baby to be blessed with such an incredible one is truly something spectacular. Everyday she brings is so much joy and love I wonder what we did before her.
