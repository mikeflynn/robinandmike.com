We had such a fun weekend this past weekend. I passed the 35 week mark&#8230;.getting pretty close, and we were so blessed to have a couple of baby showers. Saturday my good friend Anne and little sis, Ashley, hosted a beautiful shower. We had yummy brunch food, and talked with good friends, and even some old United Services co-workers which was awesome. It&#8217;s so fun to celebrate our little girl and to have so many wonderful women around supporting us and getting excited with us. Sunday night Ashley once again played host for a baby shower BBQ with old Apple friends. It was again so much fun. Ashley and her roommate Eric did such an amazing job with the food, drinks, and just everything. And once again it was so much fun to celebrate with friends especially friends I haven&#8217;t seen in awhile. These last couple of days I&#8217;ve been organizing and washing clothes, and just trying to get her nursery in order. Slowly but surely it&#8217;s looking more like a room, but I&#8217;m anxious to have everything together. There&#8217;s not a lot new in baby land but I&#8217;ll do a little update for you anyway.

**How Far Along: **35 Weeks

**Weight Gain: **My guess last week was right on at the doctor&#8217;s office I was up 17 pounds. I feel a lot bigger than that, but thankful that that number isn&#8217;t much bigger.

******Maternity Clothes: **That&#8217;s the only thing that will even kind of fit and even then some shirts are looking a little obnoxious.

******Movement:** Still the same lots of feet (I&#8217;m guessing) in my ribs. She&#8217;s definitely running out of space because I pretty much feel her in the same place each time.

**What I miss: **Being comfortable. There is no comfortable position&#8230;.sitting hurts, standing hurts, sleeping hurts, there is just no way around it. I&#8217;m thinking this is only going to get worse before it gets better.

**What&#8217;s up with my body:** Nothing really new. I&#8217;m having more tailbone and hip pain again not really sure what&#8217;s causing that but hoping it goes away soon.

**What&#8217;s up with the baby: **Here&#8217;s a little blurb from babycenter.com about what the baby is doing this week:

> Your baby doesn&#8217;t have much room to maneuver now that he&#8217;s over 18 inches long and tips the scales at 5 1/4 pounds ([pick up a honeydew melon][1]). Because it&#8217;s so snug in your womb, he isn&#8217;t likely to be doing somersaults anymore, but the number of times he kicks should remain about the same. His kidneys are fully developed now, and his liver can process some waste products. Most of his basic physical development is now complete — he&#8217;ll spend the next few weeks putting on weight.

**Gender: **It&#8217;s a GIRL!__

**Emotions:** Nothing too nutty. Just getting anxious but excited. Feeling unsure about what to expect for labor but really wanting to meet this little one.

**Best part of the week: **Our baby showers! Getting to celebrate with so many people that love us and that already love our little girl is such a blessing. Can&#8217;t wait for everyone to meet her.
