I have a very love/hate relationship with Facebook. I love that I can see pictures of my friends new twin girls or that I can share pictures of Molly. I love that I can connect with other moms and ask questions or get advice. But I also kind of hate Facebook&#8230;.I hate that people post the absolute stupidest crap or they put stuff up there that seems like it&#8217;s only there to make me feel bad (ie. I can&#8217;t believe you would feed your baby rice don&#8217;t you know it&#8217;s practically poison) super annoying, but this past weekend I saw exactly what I needed to see on Facebook. 

We were having a super hard weekend with Molly. She wasn&#8217;t sleeping well, and screaming when we put her to bed, which was so unusual for her. During the day she was crying a lot, so frustrated and clingy. Not our finest moments, but I stumbled across [this article][1] and it was exactly what I needed in that moment. A little reminder that I am Molly&#8217;s mommy and there is a reason for all the crying, frustrations, and clingyness even if I don&#8217;t know exactly what that reason is. These days won&#8217;t be forever and she won&#8217;t always need me to hold her before she falls asleep, but whenever she does I will try to remember the beauty in those moments. 

So every once in awhile there is something perfect waiting for you in your Facebook feed.
