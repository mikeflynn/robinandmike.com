Is actually here! Born at 9:16pm on September 24, 2012 weighing 8 lbs 14 oz and 21 inches long , after 22 crazy long hours of labor. It&#8217;s been a pretty unbelievable week, I can&#8217;t quite put it into words. This week of course has had its challenges but Mike and I are doing well&#8230;.tired but well. I&#8217;ll try to continue to post updates and photos it just may take some time before I&#8217;m rested enough and Molly is giving us enough time for blogging.
