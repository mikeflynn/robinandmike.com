Everything has really settled down from our travels this summer. Ashley has been with us for a couple of months and now she&#8217;s moving out. I&#8217;m definitely a little bummed, but she&#8217;s not moving far. Just up the road a few blocks, I&#8217;m sure she will be over for family dinner many many times. Michael is starting to play softball with a league from his work so Tuesday nights will soon be dedicated to that. I am personally looking forward to September 25th when my mom and big sister are coming up so that we all can go to the So You Think You Can Dance Tour. Cannot Wait! All is pretty good here, and here&#8217;s a picture of Abby just because she&#8217;s so dang cute.
