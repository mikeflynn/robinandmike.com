This past week has been lots of fun. Last Wednesday Mom and I took off for Atlanta for a visit with Erin. We got there Wednesday evening and were able to stay until Monday which was so much fun. We were there for Erin&#8217;s work baby shower, we shopped at lots of baby consignment stores, went to lots of yummy restaurants, shopped at IKEA, and helped Erin get ready for her baby by cooking and freezing food and getting the baby&#8217;s room a little more organized (she&#8217;s 37 weeks so baby could be here anytime). It was a great visit but getting there and coming home was a little less than fun. After about 4 or so hours in the car I started getting really uncomfortable and my feet and hands continued to swell. Not comfy. Unfortunately I think that means I will not be traveling again until our baby is here. It&#8217;s just not worth the days worth of swelling after and the pain during. I had a doctor&#8217;s appointment this morning so all that good stuff will be in the update, so here it goes&#8230;..

**How Far Along:** 30 Weeks

**Weight Gain:** According to the doctor&#8217;s scale I&#8217;m up one more pound for a total of 13. I think that&#8217;s pretty good. I&#8217;d love to keep my total weight gained between 20 and 25 so with around 9 weeks to go I&#8217;m think that is very doable.

******Maternity Clothes:** Yes for sure, but even some of my maternity stuff doesn&#8217;t fit too comfortably. Between maternity clothes and this excessive heat here I really don&#8217;t have a lot of options. You can usually find me in a maternity tank with a jersey skirt. Which isn&#8217;t bad but I miss having different things to wear or being able to jazz up an outfit with a fancy shirt or heels. Not happening right now.

******Movement:** Lots of movement she&#8217;s definitely a mover and a shaker. Her movement has changed quite a bit in the last couple of weeks. Instead of single kicks or punches they are more like clustered movements. Last night me and baby were playing a kicking game&#8230;.she kicked pretty hard on my left side and I pushed down and felt what I think was a foot (or knee/elbow) then she kicked back, I pushed back, and she kicked again. Could have just been a coincidence but I like to think she was playing with me. Mike has also been able to feel a little body part which is pretty fun.

**What I miss:** A really good nights sleep. I&#8217;m currently sleeping on the couch which is a lot better than trying to sleep in our bed but I&#8217;m still up about 3 or so times during the night to go to the bathroom. Trying to find a comfy position to fall asleep has also become more and more of a challenge. I&#8217;m hoping that it doesn&#8217;t get too bad because I&#8217;m running out of options for places to sleep here.

**What&#8217;s up with my body:** So many things and none of them good&#8230;.I will start by saying that we&#8217;ve officially hit the gross stage. I will just leave it at that, for any of you that are reading and have been pregnant before you will know what I mean. And if not well you really just don&#8217;t want to know. Also last night I had what I&#8217;m pretty sure was at least one contraction. I was laying down trying to get comfortable to sleep and my entire abdomen tightened up like a menstrual cramp. I&#8217;ve had the tightening before but never painful and last night there was definitely pain. I told the doctor about it this morning and she said as long as those go away fairly quickly then it&#8217;s okay if not to call them. Pretty unsettling but everything seems to be okay. My swollen feet are okay most days but if I run too many errands, travel or just over do it I see and feel it in my feet and now also in my hands. It&#8217;s just not as easy to get stuff done during the day especially if it&#8217;s out of the house stuff.

******What&#8217;s up with the baby: **Here&#8217;s a little blurb from babycenter.com about what the baby is doing this week:

> _Your baby&#8217;s about 15.7 inches long now, and she weighs almost 3 pounds ([like a head of cabbage][1]). A pint and a half of amniotic fluid surrounds her, but that volume will decrease as she gets bigger and takes up more room in your uterus. Her eyesight continues to develop, though it&#8217;s not very keen; even after she&#8217;s born, she&#8217;ll keep her eyes closed for a good part of the day. When she does open them, she&#8217;ll respond to changes in light but will have 20/400 vision — which means she can only make out objects a few inches from her face. (Normal adult vision is 20/20.)_

It&#8217;s been hard to picture that there is a baby in my ever growing belly but since feeling that little foot or whatever it was it is easier to imagine and get excited for this little girl joining our family. I also had the doctor this morning show me how she was sitting in my belly which is pretty cool.

**Gender: **It&#8217;s a GIRL!__

**Emotions:** Just getting excited. My little nephew will be coming so soon so the reality that our little girl will be here is really setting in.

******Best part of the week:** Spending time with Erin was so awesome, but it was also amazing to come home to a built crib. I love having a space for our baby and being able to finally get her room put together.
