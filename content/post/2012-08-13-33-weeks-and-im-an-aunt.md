This past Friday Aug. 10th my sister Erin gave birth to a healthy baby boy!! We are so excited. I would love to go down and see her and baby Hayden but it&#8217;s just too hard right now. Hopefully soon enough. Things have been a little more busy here at the Flynn household.

Two weeks ago Mike and I started a 4 week childbirth class at the hospital. So far it&#8217;s been really good, lots of good information. We&#8217;ve been working on a few house projects trying to get them finished up and get the house back together before baby arrives. Luckily we&#8217;ve got about 7 more weeks. Since I missed the last couple of weeks here&#8217;s a baby update for you&#8230;..

**How Far Along: **33 Weeks

**Weight Gain:** At my doctor&#8217;s appointment about a week ago I was up one more pound for a total of 14.

******Maternity Clothes:** That is really the only option. But while I&#8217;m home I will wear some of my old tank tops and it&#8217;s pretty funny to see my belly hanging out the bottom. For so long those shirts fit okay it really hits home how big my belly has gotten.

******Movement:** Movement is pretty much the same as a few weeks ago. Lots of movement but very different from when we first started feeling her. Less kicks more like stretches and rolls. She is hanging out pretty high so I often get a foot/knee/elbow/hand in my ribs. Makes it difficult to breathe sometimes, hopefully I&#8217;ll get some relief when she drops lower in my belly in a few weeks.

**What I miss:** Wearing all my shoes. I&#8217;m on a all flip flops diet right now and I don&#8217;t love it. I LOVE my high heels and my ballet flats and I cannot wear any of them. I&#8217;m hoping that my feet are only swollen and not actually getting larger I would be so sad if my favorite shoes won&#8217;t fit after this. Well I guess on the plus side I would have to buy new shoes.

**What&#8217;s up with my body:** Just feeling big&#8230;.I can&#8217;t bend the way I want to, and I need about 5 pillows to lay comfortably on my side, and about 2 of those need to be under the belly. It needs a lot more support than I ever imagined. I&#8217;m not loving the swollen feet and my hands are joining that party too. They feel tight all the time. It&#8217;s just those little things that add up to just uncomfortable.

******What&#8217;s up with the baby: **Here&#8217;s a little blurb from babycenter.com about what the baby is doing this week:

> _This week your baby weighs a little over 4 pounds ([heft a pineapple][1]) and has passed the 17-inch mark. He&#8217;s rapidly losing that wrinkled, alien look and his skeleton is hardening. The bones in his skull aren&#8217;t fused together, which allows them to move and slightly overlap, thus making it easier for him to fit through the birth canal. (The pressure on the head during birth is so intense that many babies are born with a [conehead-like appearance][2].) These bones don&#8217;t entirely fuse until early adulthood, so they can grow as his brain and other tissue expands during infancy and childhood._

She is most definitely getting bigger. You can often feel her back/booty/and maybe head on the outside of my belly. I keep telling Mike that it feels like she is going to push through.

**Gender: **It&#8217;s a GIRL!__

**Emotions:** I feel myself getting a little crankier than I normally would which is a little unnerving. I don&#8217;t want to be this grumpy person the next two months, but man sometimes it&#8217;s hard. I find things that never used to get on my nerves just making me nuts. Probably good that I can just be with the cat most days.

******Best part of the week: **Seeing pictures of my nephew!! He is so cute. I got a little emotional talking to Erin on the phone because I want to be there with her so much. It kind of sucks knowing her friends and neighbors are all getting to spend time with him before I will. I also hate not know when we will see each other again. I know it will be fine but I&#8217;m anxious to meet him and my little girl.
