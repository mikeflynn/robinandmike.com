Mike and I have always loved visiting Las Vegas. We went for our honeymoon and have returned almost every year since then and this year was no different. My mom came to CA to stay with Molly and Mike and I headed to Vegas for four days of good food, relaxing by the pool and just a little bit of gambling. We had a great time. We stayed at the Encore which is a beautiful hotel and casino and since it&#8217;s a little smaller it was not nearly as crowded or busy as some of the other casinos which was nice. The only real downside is since it&#8217;s more on the edge of the strip we had to walk a significant distance to some of our other favorite places, not a huge deal but my easily blistered feet were not pleased. When we planned the trip we basically just picked a weekend and didn&#8217;t realize it would be over Mother&#8217;s Day. It was a great day that I was able to completely relax, but it was a little bittersweet to not spend Mother&#8217;s Day with my favorite girl. But we went out for some amazing dinners at some places we had never been but then of course we went to some of our favorites&#8230;Andrea&#8217;s in the Encore, Olives at Bellagio, the secret pizza place at the Cosmopolitan, and Mesa Grill at Caesars Palace. We did not walk away winning any money but we had a blast getting dressed up every night and sleeping in every day, and Molly had a great time hanging out with Grandma win win for everyone. Not sure if we will be able to go back next year but I&#8217;m sure we will try its great to be able to completely shut off that parent part of your brain and just enjoy everything around you.
