Mike, Molly and I spent the week if Thanksgiving on Isle of the Palms, SC with Mike&#8217;s extended family. We had such a good time. The nights were pretty rough Molly continues to struggle to sleep in the pack and play in mama and daddy&#8217;s room but the days were a lot of fun. Molly got to spend some time on the beach which she loved and we all got to hang out with all the Flynn aunts, uncles, and cousins. We also got to meet baby Lucy who was born almost exactly a year after Molly. It was fun to remember where we were a year ago and see just how much Molly has grown this past year. After a week on the beach Mike headed back to CA to get back to work while Molly and I spent some time in Atlanta with Erin, Chris and Hayden. We had pretty crappy weather but we didn&#8217;t take Molly and Hayden to see Santa which they hated. We felt pretty bad for laughing at their terror but it was so cute. 

We are all back in CA for a couple of weeks and then it&#8217;s off to MO for a quick trip to celebrate Christmas with my family and visit some St Louis friends. 

It&#8217;s a busy holiday season but we sure do enjoy getting to spend time with our families.

Here&#8217;s some pics of Molly enjoying the beach (it was a little chilly out but she didn&#8217;t care)
