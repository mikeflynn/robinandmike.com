Sorry I&#8217;ve been neglecting the blog this week, but I&#8217;m back in Missouri!!!! Yay!! I came home by myself so that I could go to my best friend and old college roommate&#8217;s wedding in Columbia, MO. I had such an amazing weekend and was so excited that my little sister could join me (since Michael had to stay back in Jerusalem). It was a beautiful wedding and we had so much fun. It has been really nice to be back in the states and enjoy some non kosher food.

Michael will be coming back in early June so that we can go to his brother&#8217;s wedding and then it&#8217;s back to Jerusalem for both of us. But for right now I&#8217;m going to enjoy time with family and friends and soak up as much meat and dairy in the same meal as I can.
