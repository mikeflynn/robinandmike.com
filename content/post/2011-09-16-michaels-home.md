It&#8217;s so nice I went to the airport and picked Michael up this morning. We had a really great lazy day and enjoyed some really good fast food. It&#8217;s definitely something we both craved after being in Jerusalem so it was a great treat for him. Right now he&#8217;s sleeping on the couch not sure how he will do getting back on St Louis time, but honestly I&#8217;m just so happy he&#8217;s here. I don&#8217;t care how he does getting back on a sleep schedule. Not sure whats next but I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s here so we can do it together.
