My mom and I took Molly to get her picture taken with Santa Claus.

We went to Whole Foods where they were offering free pictures with Santa. They aren&#8217;t the best but I guess you get what you pay for, but we went, we met him, and we photographed it so really what more could you ask for. Molly was very uncertain, but didn&#8217;t cry while Santa held her.
