This past weekend we had our first visitors to our new place in Millbrae. Mike&#8217;s younger brother Matt and his wife Aleysa came while Matt was on spring break from school. We had a fun day in San Francisco and Molly enjoyed having some more people to giggle with. We definitely aren&#8217;t settled into our new place so it was a little weird to have people here but we had a nice weekend and its always good to see family.
