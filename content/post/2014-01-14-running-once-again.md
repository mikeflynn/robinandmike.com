I recently started training for my next half marathon. I&#8217;m excited to take this challenge once again. Almost immediately following my race in San Jose I got an email from the Rock and Roll race people about the San Francisco race. I hesitated to sign up but when I saw the course I was sold. It looks like a beautiful race and the halfway point is literally the Golden Gate Bridge. I have been wanting the run the bridge but it&#8217;s just not easy to get over there and park just to run it so I thought here&#8217;s my chance to get on the bridge.
  
I&#8217;m taking a different approach to training this time. I&#8217;m following the Nike Half Marathon plan which is about three runs a week and three workouts with the Nike training app. So far it&#8217;s going good I either run with Molly or after she&#8217;s gone to bed on the treadmill and I do the workouts either during nap time or after she&#8217;s gone to bed. I definitely could have trained harder and better for my first race so I&#8217;m excited to take a little different approach and see how that effects me on race day. I&#8217;ll keep you posted.
