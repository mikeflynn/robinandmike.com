So I&#8217;m incredibly late writing this post, but I just had a baby so I feel like I get a pass. But my first real night out after Molly was an amazing one&#8230;.my good friend Barrett and I went and saw Madonna in concert, it was amazing!! We first went to dinner at Sidney Street Cafe. I&#8217;ve written about Sidney Street before and it did not disappoint (thankfully we went there before I went off dairy). After that we headed to the show, and were there some crazy people to see. It was nuts!!
  
We bought some cool concert t&#8217;s and got super excited about the show. Madonna didn&#8217;t start until late but the show was truly incredible. The dances were awesome and she had a great mix of old and new songs. It was such a great night. It ended a little rough when I got home at 1am to find a very awake baby and a very tired daddy. Molly did not have as much fun that night. But her and Mike survived and hopefully he will be open to me having a night out again soon.
