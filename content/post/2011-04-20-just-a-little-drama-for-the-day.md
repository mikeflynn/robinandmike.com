Currently I am sitting in the Presidential Club at Newark Airport. Our first flight this morning out of St. Louis was delayed by about two and half hours which in turn caused us to miss our connecting flight in Newark to Tel Aviv. So here we sit waiting for the next flight. It wouldn&#8217;t be that bad but we now have about a five hour layover and will be boarding about 10pm local time which puts us in Tel Aviv about 4pm Thursday afternoon. My big decision now is when to sleep. Too much on the plane will mean no sleep once we get there and too little means sleeping right away and waking up in the middle of the night. Pretty sure sleep will just be a little wacky for a few days. For now we will sit enjoy the free WiFi, next stop Tel Aviv.
