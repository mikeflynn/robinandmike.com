A while back I read on [acoursetothefinishline.wordpress.com][1] about a race that she ran and she kept a list of people to focus on, meditate to, or just think about during her run. She was making her miles matter, and I thought that it was a really cool idea. I have since seen others complete a similar list for their races and decided that I would do the same. So here&#8217;s who&#8217;s on my list and why they are important to me.

Mile 1 &#8211; Mike and Molly: this is fairly obvious but I really couldn&#8217;t do this without Mike&#8217;s help. Having him watch Molly anytime I need to do a long run is amazing and I couldn&#8217;t do it without him. And Molly well she is the reason I do everything that I do. I can&#8217;t wait for the day that we can run in a race together.

Mile 2 &#8211; My big sister Erin: Erin started running a few months or maybe even a year before I did and she always inspires me and pushes me to do more. I have no doubt that if it wasn&#8217;t for her I never would have completed my first half marathon let alone a second.

Mile 3 &#8211; My mom: She is always so encouraging and always my cheerleader.

Mile 4 &#8211; My little sister, Ashley: Ashley also is always in my corner, always encouraged, and supported me when one day I decided that I was going to be a runner.

Mile 5 &#8211; Grandma Wieczorek: My grandma is seriously amazing, she is living with my uncle on the farm even in her late eighties. She also have broken her hip twice and both times healed perfectly and is still walking without a walker or a cane. So inspirational.

Mile 6 &#8211; Grandpa Wieczorek: Like my grandma he was one of the hardest working men I knew, up farming every morning even after he &#8220;retired&#8221; He also came back from a pretty nasty bull attack like it was nothing. Those two were so strong in their relationship it was so beautiful. Good thoughts just before the halfway point.

Mile 7 &#8211; Nancy McGee: My old boss at Apple who is an amazing businesswoman, mother, and athlete. When I think of her I always push harder because I know Nancy wouldn&#8217;t quit and neither will I.

Mile 8 &#8211;  John: Because he is simply the best dad I could ever ask for, and I know he is so proud of what I&#8217;ve achieved

Mile 9 &#8211; Runners everywhere: For inspiring me to run, and to run further than I ever thought possible.

Mile 10 &#8211; Running Bloggers: like acoursetothefinishline.com and dogmomchasingthestork.com I can read their training, their up and downs, and I work harder knowing that they are doing it and so can I.

Mile 11 &#8211; Our First Baby: Because you first made me a mother, and I will always love and think of you.

Mile 12 &#8211; Nancy McGee: Yes again, because Mile 12 is going to be hard the last mile is always hard but I know Nancy would push through it and get to the finish line so I will think of her and push too.

Mile 13.1 &#8211; Mike and Molly: Everything I do starts and finishes with these two. They are my world and I&#8217;m so lucky to have them.

I&#8217;m getting very excited about this race. I of course haven&#8217;t trained as much as I probably should but I&#8217;m feeling ready. Sunday morning will be here soon.
