Moving away is such a weird thing you can be so excited and looking forward to new challenges and a new start all while being so sad to leave friends and family behind. I left St Louis last Tuesday and I&#8217;m flying to San Francisco on Monday so there have been a lot of goodbyes and definitely some tears. I&#8217;ve been so lucky to have family close and so many wonderful friends that have always been there for me and if I could pack them all up and take them with me I certainly would but with all the luggage restrictions at the airport this would be extremely difficult so instead it&#8217;s time to say goodbye and even though it sucks I really cannot wait to get on that plane. I can&#8217;t wait to see what&#8217;s next for us.
