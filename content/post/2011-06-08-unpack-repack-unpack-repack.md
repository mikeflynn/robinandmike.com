Today I am packing up our suitcases again so that Michael and I can jump on a plane first thing tomorrow morning to get to St. Croix for Michael&#8217;s brothers wedding. I know Michael is dreading getting on a plane again. He just got home late Monday night after a long 24 hours of travel home from Jerusalem and now just over 48 hours later another plane. Hopefully once we get there both Michael and I will be able to relax and enjoy the beach. I know for me all I can think about is once we get back from St. Croix we will need to really get organized and get back to Jerusalem at the end of the week. It&#8217;s just so many planes so much travel in such a short amount of time. I am definitely ready to just get back to Jerusalem and get into a groove again and just live our lives until August. This trip back home has been amazing, but also exhausting trying to see everyone and do everything knowing that our time back here is so limited. Fingers crossed that we will have beautiful weather for the wedding and we will be able to enjoy the beach and then it&#8217;s off to Israel again. I&#8217;m so ready to get back there so that we can come back home for good.
