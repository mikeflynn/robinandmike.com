This post is a few days late but I&#8217;ve really been enjoying all the birthday fun. Erin, Ashley and I had an amazing girls weekend here in St. Louis. We ate some incredible food (thanks to <a href="http://www.restaurantpi.com/" target="_blank">Pi</a> and <a href="http://enjoysalt.com/default.htm" target="_blank">Salt</a>!) We stayed in a wonderful room at the <a href="http://www.chaseparkplaza.com/" target="_blank">Chase Park Plaza</a> and really just had a great weekend. As much as I had been dreading turning 30 having such a fun weekend really made it worth it. The birthday fun continued last night when Mike took me out for a fancy birthday dinner and he really did great. We went to <a href="http://www.sidneystreetcafe.com/" target="_blank">Sidney Street Cafe</a> which is just up the street from our house. We decided to do the chef&#8217;s tasting menu and seriously had the best five courses I&#8217;ve ever eaten. Absolutely amazing. If you live in St. Louis or near St. Louis Sidney Street definitely needs to be on your must eat at list. It&#8217;s been a great weekend and week and I loved every moment of it.

So now on to baby stuff&#8230;.

**How Far Along:** 16 Weeks

**Weight Gain:** Last time I weighed myself at home which was on Saturday I was up one pound from pre pregnancy weight. My doctor had commented at both of my last appointments that I hadn&#8217;t gained any weight yet&#8230;.not really concerned just mentioned it so I&#8217;m relieved to see the scale moving in the right direction. I have a feeling it will only be going up from here until the end. Which I sometimes have to remind myself is a good thing.

**Maternity Clothes:** Yes definitely yes. I&#8217;ve been wearing maternity pants for about a month now. I can still fit into my old jeans using a belly band but frankly it&#8217;s just not very comfortable. If I&#8217;m just meeting someone for lunch I could do it but for all day the maternity pants are a must. I have some maternity tops that I&#8217;ve gotten on sale at Old Navy and Gap but I can still fit into my old tops (some better than others). I did splurge and get a pair of skinny jeans for full price at the Gap. I honestly just couldn&#8217;t imagine another month of wearing the same pair of jeans every day. And the new jeans are so cute and fit so well. So I think definitely worth it. I&#8217;m still on the fence about whether or not I look pregnant or if it looks like I just ate a little too much for lunch. I think if you know me and see me all the time you would definitely think baby bump but for strangers on the street they are probably still guessing.

**Movement:** Nope not yet but I&#8217;m really excited to start feeling this little one. The books say you can feel movement as early as 16 weeks but that it may take longer. So far anything that I&#8217;ve been feeling I&#8217;m pretty sure is just ligament pain, stretching and all that stuff, not the baby. But I&#8217;m so excited for those first movements I think it could be any time now but I&#8217;m expecting it to realistically take a few more weeks.

**What I miss:** I really miss a good lunchmeat sandwich. It&#8217;s fine for me to eat lunchmeat as long as I heat it up before I eat it which frankly doesn&#8217;t sound that good. I really want a ham sandwich from Jimmy John&#8217;s. I keep getting these other hot sandwiches thinking it will take care of the craving but so far nope. I am excited because Erin was talking to me about this place called FireHouse Subs where they steam the meat before making a sandwich (and in turn make it pregnancy safe) she said they are absolutely amazing. I almost fell out of my car when I saw one was coming close to where I nanny the boys. It&#8217;s not open yet but seriously I think I&#8217;ll be the first customer. Can&#8217;t wait and really hoping it will take care of my sandwich desires.

**What&#8217;s up with my body:** Oh so many things seem to be going on. The biggest thing I&#8217;ve noticed this week especially is I&#8217;m absolutely exhausted. Around 1 in the afternoon I cannot keep my eyes open and can fall asleep so fast and sleep hard. I&#8217;ve had lots of ligament pain and other pain that feels like stretching in my uterus. Part of me wonders if it&#8217;s the baby I&#8217;m feeling but I know it&#8217;s just ligaments and joints. So lots of sleeping and lots of stretching.

**What&#8217;s up with the baby:** According to baby center.com this week starts a big growth spurt for the baby (which I&#8217;m guessing may be why I&#8217;m so tired) and that he or she will double it&#8217;s weight in the next weeks. Right now baby is about the size of an avocado I&#8217;ve also heard turnip. The baby&#8217;s heart is also pumping blood through it&#8217;s little body. Pretty cool to think. Apparently the baby can sense light through it&#8217;s fused eye lids, so if we were to shine a flashlight on my belly the baby would likely move away from the light. I couldn&#8217;t feel it but it would be happening. It seems that the baby is still developing but is gaining a lot more weight too. I&#8217;m so excited for our next ultrasound so we can see how much the baby has changed since the last one at 9 weeks.

**Gender:** We will hopefully be finding out the gender at our next appointment but for now we are stuck on girl.

**Emotions:** Mike surprised me with a York Peppermint Patty after I off hand mentioned that I wanted one and I cried like a big baby. That&#8217;s right over a York Peppermint Patty. For the record they are good but definitely not that good. Pretty funny when Mike looked over at me and was like &#8220;Are you crying&#8221; and yes I was.

**Best part of the week:** Probably all the birthday fun. Even though it wasn&#8217;t exactly related to the baby it feels good to ring in 30 with style.

And here&#8217;s a pic for you&#8230;.not the best to show off the belly but it&#8217;s of me and Erin again before our dinner at Salt. I am in a completely non-maternity outfit and just barely could make those pants work with the help of a belly band.
