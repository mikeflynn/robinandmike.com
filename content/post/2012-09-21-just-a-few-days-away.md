Well we have a date!!!! After my last doctors appointment we decided that the safest route would be to induce labor and get little girl on the outside. There is still a real concern about her shoulders and belly, but we are hopeful that having her sooner and not later will hopefully prevent a c- section. So Sunday night we will be headed to the hospital to start the process&#8230;pretty crazy to look at the calendar and know she will be here so soon.
