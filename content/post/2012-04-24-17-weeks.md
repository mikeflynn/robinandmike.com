**How Far Along: **17 Weeks

**Weight Gain:** According to my scale here at home I&#8217;m up about another pound maybe two which puts me up 2 to 3 total pounds from before pregnancy. Not really that exciting but I should be gaining about a pound a week so so far I&#8217;m meeting that.

******Maternity Clothes:** Still yes but I also made a move and bought some new bras this week. I had been squeezing into my pre-pregnancy bras and it was getting way too uncomfortable and frankly not very cute. I&#8217;m much happier now that I have some bigger bras and I don&#8217;t feel like my ribs are getting squeezed all day long. Hopefully they will last a while. The lady at Destination Maternity was confident that they should be good throughout the rest of the pregnancy so I guess we will just see.

******Movement: **Nothing for sure. I&#8217;ve been having this feeling I can&#8217;t really describe it, but it&#8217;s low on my belly happens a couple of times a day and is usually happens in a similar spot. Now I can&#8217;t say yes this is the baby moving around, but I&#8217;m guessing that it may be with lots of question marks on that may be???? I&#8217;m very anxious to start feeling this little one and hope it happens sooner rather than later. I guess all I can do is wait and see and continue to obsess over every stretch and pull.

**What I miss:** Runny eggs. Oh man I would love a good runny egg right now. One thing that would help you understand this huge desire for a runny egg is knowing a little more about me and Mike. In all our years together I don&#8217;t even think I could guess how many runny eggs we have made and eaten. Weekends we make eggs, lazy dinner we make eggs, when we were in Jerusalem and couldn&#8217;t go out for another dinner we stayed home and made eggs. I&#8217;ve been craving eggs and will make an egg and cheese sandwich with a hard egg, but I miss that runny yolk. I&#8217;m sure soon enough this egg thing will pass and I will want something else but for now all I want is a runny egg.

******What&#8217;s up with my body: **Nothing really new this week. I continue to be absolutely exhausted. I&#8217;ve had a couple of rough nights where I&#8217;ve been up from like 3am &#8211; 5am or 4am &#8211; 5am and I&#8217;m not sure how much that is contributing to my sleepiness during the day, but whatever it is I&#8217;m tired. On the days I nanny I really try to stay awake even when the boys are napping because they don&#8217;t sleep as long as I would want to so I end of feeling groggy and worse if I do sleep so the goal is to stay awake with them and nap for a couple hours after I get home until Mike gets home. The only problem with that is there have been a few times that he&#8217;s worked late and I ended up taking a three hour nap which is a little long. Oh well it doesn&#8217;t seem to be interfering with my nighttime sleep so I&#8217;m not worrying about it. I been feeling pretty good (or at least better) the last couple of weeks and my nausea has been much better, but it&#8217;s definitely gotten worse again the last couple of days and especially today. Not fun. I was really hoping that those days were mostly behind us but it seems as though they are not. All I can hope is that I will have more not nauseous days than nauseous days.

**What&#8217;s up with the baby:** Apparently this week the baby&#8217;s bones are changing from soft cartilage to bone and baby can move it&#8217;s joints. So lets get some movement going in there. Baby is about 5 ounces and about 5 1/2 inches long or about the size of a sweet potato. The baby&#8217;s nervous system is maturing and the brain is forming more complex connections that will eventually be the baby&#8217;s five senses. Lots of fun stuff going on!!

**Gender:** Still stuck on girl only about another week and a half until we hopefully will know.

**Emotions: **Nothing to ridiculous that I can think of, but I did get awfully teary eyed while watching Armageddon on TV (don&#8217;t judge me you know you like that movie too)

**Best part of the week:** Thinking that I may actually be feeling the baby. I don&#8217;t know for sure so I can&#8217;t be too excited about it, but the fact that it&#8217;s even a possibility makes me very happy.

And here&#8217;s a pic for you&#8230;.it&#8217;s not the best again to see the belly but honestly it wasn&#8217;t looking or feeling very big that day. And I&#8217;m wearing a maternity shirt which is very comfortable, but not so clingy so doesn&#8217;t really show the bump. But enjoy.
