So I have not been very good about posting here, mostly because there hasn&#8217;t been much new and exciting to talk about. But we have had a great holiday! Michael was able to take off the week between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s so it has been so nice having him home. I also had some time off from nannying so we went to the movies and enjoyed some dinners out. Last year we started a Christmas Eve tradition with Ashley and we make dips and watch Die Hard (our favorite Christmas movie) so once again we ate dips watched Die Hard, and just had fun together. Christmas Day was also a lot of fun. Mom and John came up to St. Louis and opened presents and my house with Ashley. We had breakfast over here and then later in the day we headed over to Michael&#8217;s parents&#8217; house for more presents and a huge Christmas dinner. The food was absolutely amazing and the company was even better. We had such a great day. The rest of the week we have just been hanging out. We saw The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Mission Impossible 4 both outstanding movies. We did a little after Christmas shopping and rearranged Michael&#8217;s office. It&#8217;s super cute now.

Tonight we will be going out and celebrating the New Year in Soulard with Ashley. I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to 2012 and what adventures it has in store. 2011 took a lot of turns that I didn&#8217;t expect but it really was a fun ride. So here&#8217;s to the next year, Cheers!!
