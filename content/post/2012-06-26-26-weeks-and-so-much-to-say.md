It has been incredibly busy here at the Flynn&#8217;s (which is why I&#8217;ve been so late at updating the blog&#8230;sorry) Last week started out with a last minute trip to South Dakota to go help my Grandma who is recovering from a fractured hip. I left for South Dakota early Monday morning and was back home by Thursday afternoon. It was a quick trip but so wonderful. The week ended with a 31st birthday for Mike and a baby shower for Erin here at our house so it has definitely been a full week.

South Dakota was awesome. I&#8217;m getting really good at driving around those country roads and finding my way around which is pretty cool. I was able to hang out with family and help my Grandma with some things so that was really nice. We enjoyed some lazy afternoons too which I think we both really needed. One very unfortunate side effect of the heat and the travel were my extremely swollen feet. It was insane. I of course only brought one pair of ballet flats which by Tuesday I could not squeeze my feet in to. Luckily the local Shopko had lots of flip flops on sale so I bought a cheap pair and was able to travel home comfortably. Thankfully since being home they haven&#8217;t gotten that big again, just a little swelling on the days I&#8217;m on my feet more. But it was a great trip. I had to get back to St. Louis though so I could finish getting everything together for Erin&#8217;s baby shower which was Saturday. We had an absolutely blast over the weekend. It was so good to see Erin and be able to hang out with some of her friends, eating good food, and just catching up. It was a lovely shower. But the best part was I got to spend the weekend with Erin. On Sunday before Erin had to leave for the airport we got our pictures taken by Ryan Walters (and old coworker from Apple and amazing photographer). We had so much fun at the photo shoot and the pictures are amazing. Here&#8217;s a little preview of what he was able to capture [http://ryanwalters.virb.com/robin&#8211;erin][1] You should definitely check out more of his work at [blog.rwvisuals.com][2]. So as exhausting as last week was it was truly a great week. So now on to the weekly update:

**How Far Along: **26 Weeks

**Weight Gain: **I weighed myself here at home and according to my scale I&#8217;m up 12lbs since pre-pregnancy. But I only gained just over a pound in two weeks. I go to the doctor on Friday and I&#8217;ll definitely be talking to her about my lack of appetite. Hopefully I&#8217;m still in the good range as far as weight goes.

******Maternity Clothes:** For sure&#8230;but today everything I had on wasn&#8217;t maternity which is kind of funny. An Old Navy jersey knit skirt and Target Long and Lean tank top&#8230;.might as well be maternity clothes. While I was in South Dakota I packed a couple of t-shirts that I haven&#8217;t worn in a while, I didn&#8217;t really think they they may not fit and luckily I could squeeze into them, but I wouldn&#8217;t say they looked good or fit. It&#8217;s a good thing I had a long tank top under the shirt otherwise it would have been more of a belly shirt. I think if I want to wear a t-shirt I&#8217;ll have to steal from Mike I&#8217;m sure he will love that.

******Movement: **She is definitely moving it is undeniable and real which of course makes me panic just a little (okay a lot) if I haven&#8217;t felt her in a while. The night before my trip I was very worried because I couldn&#8217;t remember feeling her much that day. I was also running around all day getting things ready for my trip, but still it was a little unnerving. She perked up the next day and I felt her moving and grooving while I was traveling so that definitely put my mind to ease. Her movement still isn&#8217;t real big, Mike can kind of feel her but he says it&#8217;s very faint. I&#8217;m sure that will change but for now it&#8217;s still more like flutters than full on kicks and punches.

**What I miss:** Having more than four shirts to pick from. My wardrobe is pretty boring right now.

**What&#8217;s up with my body:** Nothing too spectacular, but a couple of funny things. 1) My belly button is just about nonexistent Mike thinks I&#8217;ve got one maybe two weeks before it kind of disappears pretty weird to see 2) Having swollen feet is pretty uncomfortable and also one of the weirdest things I&#8217;ve ever seen. It&#8217;s very unsettling to not see your ankles. Pretty sure I will never get used to that. 3) Tailbone pain is getting better. Tomorrow will be the true test when I go back to the gym and attempt to walk or get on the elliptical for 30 min or so. I go back to the physical therapist on Wednesday, but he thinks there hasn&#8217;t been too much damage done which I was very thankful to hear. I&#8217;m anxious to get back to the gym so I&#8217;m crossing my fingers that it doesn&#8217;t hurt too much tomorrow.

**What&#8217;s up with the baby: **Here&#8217;s a little blurb from babycenter.com about what the baby is doing this week:

> _The network of nerves in your baby&#8217;s ears is better developed and more sensitive than before. He may now be able to hear both your voice and your partner&#8217;s as you chat with each other. He&#8217;s inhaling and exhaling small amounts of amniotic fluid, which is essential for the development of his lungs. These so-called breathing movements are also good practice for when he&#8217;s born and takes that first gulp of air. And he&#8217;s continuing to put on baby fat. He now weighs about a pound and two-thirds and measures 14 inches ([an English hothouse cucumber][3]) from head to heel.
  
>_ 

Estimates say that she weighs anywhere from 1.5 lbs to about 2 lbs so really it&#8217;s anybody&#8217;s guess. It&#8217;s pretty crazy to think how much bigger she is than just even 8 weeks ago.

**Gender: **It&#8217;s a GIRL!__

**Emotions:** I think I&#8217;ve been fine, but maybe you should ask Mike.

******Best part of the week:** It was all a great week, seeing family in South Dakota was amazing!! Getting to spend the weekend with my sisters was also incredible and having our maternity photo shoot was definitely a milestone I won&#8217;t forget. It was such a busy week, but every day was so much fun.
