So we&#8217;ve had quite the weekend here at the old Flynn household. First Ashley came to visit on Friday so Ashley and I spent the day staining the new furniture and I hate to toot my own horn but man it looks great!!

Then on Saturday Ashley and I went around Soulard so Ashley can scope out apartments. Â She found some good ones and is hoping to move here soon, I selfishly want her here ASAP too. While we were apartment hunting, Michael was down at Cherokee Street taking in the Cinco de Mayo celebration. You can find all his pictures at his site punchingkitty.com. Ashley, her friend Kelly, and I joined Michael down at Cherokee for dinner of street tacos. They were amazing!!! I also found a cool piece of art for our downstairs bathroom. It&#8217;s called Cheeto Monsters&#8230;

And here&#8217;s the new mirror that we hung&#8230;[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-73" title="IMG_0615" src="http://robinandmike.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_0615-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://robinandmike.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_0615-225x300.jpg 225w, http://robinandmike.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_0615-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://robinandmike.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_0615.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />][1]All in all we are marking things off the list and getting things done. It&#8217;s great!! Had an amazing Friday and Saturday and then it was back to work on Sunday. Michael and I did some more staining tonight so it looks like we are going to meet my deadline of getting the furniture done by Erin&#8217;s Party!! Yay!
