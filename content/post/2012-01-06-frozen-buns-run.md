Since last month I have regularly been running and training for and upcoming 5K and next Saturday is race day. I&#8217;m running in a Frozen Buns Run. In St Louis they have Ice Days and the run is part of that. It&#8217;s been really great training and running I&#8217;m still extremely slow and can&#8217;t quite get through the 5 kilometers without walking but I&#8217;m so excited to run my first race. I have no doubt that I will finish even if it takes me awhile and have to walk some. But I love feeling like a runner plus the outfits are super cute. I&#8217;ll post pictures after the race.
