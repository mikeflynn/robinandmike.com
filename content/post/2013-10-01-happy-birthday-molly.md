Molly is one year old (plus like a week I haven&#8217;t had a chance to write this post even though I&#8217;ve been thinking about it forever). It&#8217;s pretty crazy just how fast this year went by and how much Molly has changed. Like Mike said &#8220;you were just a little screaming raisin when we brought you home&#8221; and now she has a personality and interests and even her daddy&#8217;s temper. This was a really big year for us with the move to CA but it&#8217;s been a good adventure and I&#8217;m happy that we chose to be a little crazy and move across the country with a baby. 

Now some stats on Molly- 

She currently weighs 23lbs and is 30 inches long. She is around the 75 percentile for both height and weight. 

She is wearing mostly 12 month clothes and 18 month sleepers. She wears her 18 month stuff it&#8217;s just a little big. 

She is sleeping through the night and takes about two naps a day. 

She crawls all over the place and really is no longer content in one place. I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to get stuff done during the day while making sure she stays safe.

She pulls up on everything and will walk when holding on to the furniture. She has a push cart that she uses sometimes but hasn&#8217;t quite figured it out. 

She loves our cat. Our cat on the other hand does not love her so much.

She continues to love playing with her books and when she finds something she likes she will sit and play all by herself. 

We started going to a parent child play group once a week. Molly gets to play with her friends and I get to socialize with other parents. It&#8217;s a lot of fun. 

She drinks her water from a sippy cup and eats pretty much whatever we give her but just figured out she loves BBQ. 

She nurses with me in the morning, before naps, and before bed. I&#8217;d like to continue nursing through the winter and then we will see if she&#8217;s ready (and if I&#8217;m ready) to start moving away from nursing and drinking cows milk. 

She will say Mama, Mommy, Dada, and her own way of saying Kitty. She has also signed milk and more. And she babbles all the time. 

She&#8217;s such a fun girl. It&#8217;s so fun to see her personality and listen to her &#8220;talk&#8221; I am amazed daily at how much she has grown and changed over this year and I&#8217;m looking forward to what this next year will bring.
